I think OTC is a convenient way to manage many font files.

What is OTC?
------------

OpenType CollectioN(OTC) is a multiple fonts storage in a single file format like TrueType Collection(TTC).

It was introduced by Adobe in 2014.

Adobe says this OTC format combines CFF table glyphs and makes significant storage benefits for CJK fonts.
